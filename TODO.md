## Features to add/improve

[ ] Improve data flow and functions -- functions only for data that needs solid outputs?
[x] Additional module to generate the html for the data file list (integrate however is fastest for now)
[ ] Additional module to calculate mass, cumulative mass, and release rate
[ ] Reorganize .spec file to allow for environment variables including elution volume, upper/lower curve omission, etc (maybe yaml formatted file?). Have assumed values for missing items (1 ml, no omitted standard curve points, etc)
[ ] Consider Separating out plate from .spec file if 
[ ] Add method to offset day, maybe a .offset file with a date followed by time - use dates to calculate d1, 3, ..., and use times to calculate specific offsets
